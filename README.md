# RFM Analysis using Sales Data Sample

This code is a SQL script that performs various analyses on a sales data sample.

The first part of the script shows an overview of the data sample and performs groupings of the data by product line, year, and dealsize to calculate revenue. The second part of the script analyzes the best month in each year and the best product line in November of 2003.

The next part of the script uses the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) model to segment customers into different categories based on their behavior, with the resulting segments named Best customers, High purchasing, Promising customers, Loyal customer, Normal, Almost lost, and Lost Customers.

Finally, the script applies the Pareto principle to categorize customers into segments based on their frequency and monetary value, with the resulting segments named Best customers, High purchasing, Promising customers, Loyal customer, Normal, Almost lost, and Lost Customers.
